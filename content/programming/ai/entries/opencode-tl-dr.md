1. Create new github for myLibrary
2. Ensure no secrets leaked into local folder
3. Ensure opencode settings are correct locally
4. Commit/push
5. Link to files
6. See if description is correct for what this ends up containing
7. Maybe other articles lead with TL;DR and link to appropriate files in repo
