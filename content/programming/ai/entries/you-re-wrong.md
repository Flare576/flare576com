# Vim Clipboard

I'm trying to figure out how to get Vim on my Steam Deck to allow me to copy to the system clipboard, and Google, Reddit, StackOverflow are all not helping... So I turned to Gemini

```flare
I'm using a Steam Deck as my primary PC. I'm a command-line enthusiast, but 90% of my experience is actually on a Mac, so there's a lot of "Linux" stuff, as well as "Arch" stuff that I'm trying to learn as I go. One of those things is that the version of vim that I have access to on this machine isn't compiled with clipboard support. I use tmux and can copy from visual mode with my current config, but it'd be awesome to be able to copy from vim with `"+y` like I can on Mac.
```

### The Core Problem: Vim's Clipboard Support

When Vim shows `-clipboard` in its `--version` output, it means it wasn't compiled with the necessary features to interact with the system's graphical clipboard.

On Linux, this typically relies on:

1.  **X11/Wayland Support:** Vim needs to be compiled with `+x11` or `+xterm_clipboard` (or sometimes just `+clipboard`, which implies the X11 support). This allows Vim to talk to the X server (or XWayland, which is how X applications run on a Wayland compositor like the Steam Deck's KDE Plasma in Desktop Mode).
2.  **External Tools:** Vim usually doesn't talk directly to the clipboard. Instead, it relies on external command-line utilities like `xclip` or `xsel` to put text onto or retrieve text from the X11 clipboard. If Vim is compiled with clipboard support but these tools aren't present, `"+y` will still fail.

Your current SteamOS `vim` probably lacks the compilation flags. Due to the read-only nature of the Steam Deck's root filesystem, you can't simply `sudo pacman -S vim` and expect to get a fully-featured build or install new packages directly onto the system in a persistent way.

### The Solution: `distrobox` (The Recommended Steam Deck Way)

The *best* and most supported way to get a fully functional Linux environment for development and specific tools on your Steam Deck without touching the underlying SteamOS is to use **`distrobox`**.
```

Wait, I expected "this is how you compile vim with the options you want," what the hell is **`distrobox`**?

```assistant
Distrobox is a tool that allows users to run any Linux distribution inside a container on top of their existing host system. It essentially creates a containerized environment that integrates tightly with the host, allowing users to access tools and software from other distributions without needing to dual-boot or set up a full virtual machine.
```

# HOLY ü•û, HOLD THE ‚òéÔ∏è

Forget Vim for now - I've been trying for MONTHS to figure out how to isolate software installation on the Steam Deck, and the best I've found is [hard-coded root](https://github.com/Flare576/dotfiles/blob/bd1f9638a51f3b7ae2ea1e47699028aa2cd5602f/setup/NIX/steamdeck.sh#L21) options for **`pacman`**. ([Source: elpfen@Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xgslv9/howto_installing_pacman_packages_in_userspace/)). Are you telling me all I need to do is install **`distrobox`** and...

# WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN THIS YET

... wow. OK, so, let's get a plan going.

```flare
Ok, the way I'm envisioning the solution right now is that the setup script is going to:

1. Clone the repo
2. Link the dotfiles (**~/.zshrc -> ~/dotfiles/.zshrc**, **~/.zshenv -> ~/dotfiles/.zshenv**, etc.)
3. Setup ZSH and OMZ on the host
4. Create a distrobox container called `utils`
5. Install the utilities to `utils`

I'm leaning this way because I expect to need to work with folders outside of the container (**/run/media/deck/{SD_card}** for example, as well as **/home/deck**) frequently, and my understanding of how the container will work is that I'd need to map/mount each of these, so having my `zsh` external to the container makes the most sense...

Oh, except for TMUX... if TMUX is installed and running from the container, can it actually run `zsh` on the host? Hrm, splitting them this way may not work.

I'll stop my flow-of-conciousness there and ask if my understanding of how distrobox operates is incorrect.
```

## You're Wrong

```assistant
That's an *excellent* set of thoughts, and you're touching on the very heart of how `distrobox` integrates with the host system. Let's break down your understanding and concerns:

### How `distrobox` Handles File System Access and Integration

Your understanding about needing to map/mount directories for container access is **mostly incorrect for `distrobox`**. This is a common misconception coming from more isolated container technologies like raw Docker.
```

# üêê That's Refreshing

"Mostly incorrect" is a response I **love** to hear, because it means two things.

1. I explained my thought process well enough to be understood
2. I was wrong and I'm about to learn something

```assistant
`distrobox` is specifically designed for a seamless developer experience, and it automatically mounts several critical host directories into the container by default.

**What `distrobox` *automatically* mounts/shares:**

1.  **Your Home Directory (`~`):** Your entire `/home/deck` directory on the Steam Deck host is mounted directly into `/home/deck` (or whatever your user's home directory is) inside the `distrobox` container.
    *   **Impact:** This means any dotfiles, projects, or other files in your home directory are immediately accessible from within your `distrobox` container without any special configuration. If you `cd ~` inside the container, you're in the *same* home directory as the host.
2.  **External Storage (`/run/media/deck`):** This is fantastic news for you! The `/run/media` directory (where SD cards and external drives are mounted on SteamOS) is also automatically mounted into your `distrobox` container.
    *   **Impact:** You can `cd /run/media/deck/SD_Card_Name` directly from inside your container and work with files on your SD card.
3.  **Other Crucial System Directories:** `/mnt`, `/opt`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, and various others are mounted to ensure applications within the container can interact with the host system's hardware and temporary files.
4.  **Display Server Integration (X11/Wayland):** `distrobox` automatically sets up the necessary environment variables and mounts for GUI applications run *inside* the container to display on your Steam Deck's desktop (KDE Plasma). This is why `vim` with `+clipboard` works seamlessly.
```

# Maybe It's Hallucinating

It can't **actually** be that easy, can it?

It [sure is](https://github.com/Flare576/dotfiles/blob/096ce5b6b9efd15fd167ce3ea45305f7fc68a6d2/setup/NIX/steamdeck.sh#L50-L63). I've got some guides to update...
