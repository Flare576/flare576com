# It Wasn't What I Asked For

But it was what I wanted.

```flare
Ok, error handling. I'd like a clean switch statement for renderError, but my brain often mixes Ruby, JS, Java, etc. syntax. What's the cleanest way to get a string then write it to the content block based on the number passed in?
```

Hell yes ‚Äî let‚Äôs cap this off with a clean, readable `switch`-based `renderError()` function in proper, modern JavaScript.

You're passing in a `num` (like `404`, `500`, etc.), so here‚Äôs how to structure that without tripping over Java/Ruby-style baggage:

---

## ‚úÖ Clean & Idiomatic `switch` in JavaScript

```js
function renderError(code) {
  let message;

  switch (code) {
    case 404:
      message = 'Huh. That doesn‚Äôt seem to exist. Perhaps lost in a wormhole?';
      break;
    case 500:
      message = 'Something broke ‚Äî and it wasn‚Äôt your fault. Probably.';
      break;
    case 403:
      message = 'You don‚Äôt have access to that. Or maybe it doesn‚Äôt have access to you.';
      break;
    case 418:
      message = 'Error 418: I‚Äôm a teapot. No further explanation needed.';
      break;
    default:
      message = 'An unknown anomaly occurred. Try refreshing your warp core.';
  }

  document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = `
    <div class="error-message">
      <h2>Error ${code}</h2>
      <p>${message}</p>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Optional CSS (to make it classy)

```css
.error-message {
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 4rem;
  padding: 2rem;
  background-color: #1e293b;
  color: #e2e8f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
}

.error-message h2 {
  color: #f87171; /* soft red */
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.error-message p {
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  color: #cbd5e1;
}
```

---

## üß† Notes

- `switch` uses `break` to prevent fallthrough ‚Äî classic JS quirk
- You can return early instead of using `let message`, but this layout is easier to expand or debug later
- The `default` case is like Ruby's `else`

---

Let me know if you want to animate the error panel in (like a fade or bounce) or show a little ‚Äúgo home‚Äù link for lost explorers.
