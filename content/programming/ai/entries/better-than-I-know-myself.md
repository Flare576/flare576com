# It Wasn't What I Asked For

But it was what I wanted.

```flare
Ok, error handling. I'd like a clean switch statement for renderError, but my brain often mixes Ruby, JS, Java, etc. syntax. What's the cleanest way to get a string then write it to the content block based on the number passed in?
```

Hell yes — let’s cap this off with a clean, readable `switch`-based `renderError()` function in proper, modern JavaScript.

You're passing in a `num` (like `404`, `500`, etc.), so here’s how to structure that without tripping over Java/Ruby-style baggage:

---

## ✅ Clean & Idiomatic `switch` in JavaScript

```js
function renderError(code) {
  let message;

  switch (code) {
    case 404:
      message = 'Huh. That doesn’t seem to exist. Perhaps lost in a wormhole?';
      break;
    case 500:
      message = 'Something broke — and it wasn’t your fault. Probably.';
      break;
    case 403:
      message = 'You don’t have access to that. Or maybe it doesn’t have access to you.';
      break;
    case 418:
      message = 'Error 418: I’m a teapot. No further explanation needed.';
      break;
    default:
      message = 'An unknown anomaly occurred. Try refreshing your warp core.';
  }

  document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = `
    <div class="error-message">
      <h2>Error ${code}</h2>
      <p>${message}</p>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

## ✅ Optional CSS (to make it classy)

I didn't even need to waste my time being clever, and lord knows I need all the help I can get being _classy_.
