# The Good

It's got ports for all the things, and the USB-C is detachable, so I can connect my [10ft 3.2 Gen 2](#/steamdeck/peripherals/usb-c-10ft-3-2-gen-2).

# The Bad

It's sold out :/ . I tried to find another one on Amazon with a detachable cord, but apparently that's a rarity now. Sorry!

I wasn't going to review these, but in light of **EVERY** similar dock I could find having an attached cord, I figure someone's going to look at [these coupler/adapters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CTT1FJL6?ie=UTF8&th=1). They're... Weird. They're **directional** and **mono-polar** Don't believe me?

![I wouldn't mess with you](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PwKCukZ3L._AC_SL1000_.jpg)

They absolutely work, but... you'll want to mark 'em once you figure out which way they work.

# The Ugly

The [Deckmate grip](#/steamdeck/peripherals/mechanism-deckmate-and-phone-mount) causes the Steam Deck to sit high in the middle in the dock, so I put little cardboard risers on either side, so it sits perfectly.
