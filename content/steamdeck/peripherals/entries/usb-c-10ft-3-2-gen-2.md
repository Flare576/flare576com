# The Good

Do you want a long cord to connect to a [HDMI Dock](#/steamdeck/peripherals/park-sung-7-in-1-hdmi-docking-station) to your Steam Deck from the couch, so you can use it as a controller but see your game on your TV? Then you're going to need something like this.

But I'll warn you - USB-C cords are a [frakin' nightmare](https://learn.adafruit.com/understanding-usb-type-c-cable-types-pitfalls-and-more/cable-types-and-differences). TL;DR is that there's at least 30 different permutations, and if you get the wrong one, your won't get the charge, resolution, or functionality you need.

## I Got Lucky

I ordered the right one, by accident, the first time, basically because I was looking for 100W throughput. I highly recommend this brand and this specific item.

# The Bad

None, really - it's exactly the right length to connect to my dock from my couch, it delivers the maximum resolution and charge rate.

# The Ugly

It's still a USB-C cord, so running a cord across the living room isn't ideal, but at least my kids are old enough to ~~yell at~~ notice it.
