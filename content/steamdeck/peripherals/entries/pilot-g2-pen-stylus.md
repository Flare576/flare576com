# The Good

The Pilot G2 pens are pretty great, and the stylus works 100% of the time on my device!

# The Bad

The pen works _too well_, and my wife stole my backup.

# The Ugly

I've read reviews that say the LED Steam Deck doesn't work well with this sort of stylus. If you have one, and that's true, please let me know on [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/flare576.com)!
