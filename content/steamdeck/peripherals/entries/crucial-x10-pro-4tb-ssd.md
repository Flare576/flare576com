# The Good

IT'S SO SMALL! It's also ridiculously fast, Plug-and-Play with Windows, Linux, and OSx out-of-the-box, and has storage we'll grow into as I backup our Google Photos, family storage, etc.

# The Bad

I haven't spent this much on storage since the days of Black Friday deals on 500GB HDDs, and I only did it because it was on sale at [MicroCenter](https://www.microcenter.com/) for WAY less than what it's going for now. I'm not telling you to get THIS ONE, but if you do, it'll treat you right.

# The Ugly

This one is 100% me and my needs, but I did NOT format it for exclusive use on the Steam Deck, so it won't work as "External Game Installation," but I'm _pretty sure_ it COULD do that if you wanted to format it!
