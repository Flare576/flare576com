# The Good

100W (20V 5A) is enough to power the Steam Deck (which caps at 45W) plus other accessories or devices, and it comes with a ~6ft (1.7m) cord! Bear in mind that, while the cord is rated for 100W, it is NOT rated for data transfer.

# The Bad

When plugging in multiple devices, it does a sort of power on/off thing that can mess with the Steam Deck, so I'd recommend plugging in the Deck last if you're connecting multiple things.

Also, it's GaN, which translates to "Kinda Heavy," weighing in at 8.5oz (250g). It's comparable to my laptop's charger. It's not awful, but it's noticeable in your bag.

# The Ugly

It's... rectangular? ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
