# The Good

You plug the USB-C into the top of your Steam Deck, then you plug [ALL THE THINGS](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/06/this-is-why-ill-never-be-adult.html) to the rest of the ports, and it just works.

Allow me to stress that.

**You plug in your ðŸ’©, and it just works**

It has:

- 3x Display Port 1.4
- 2x USB-A
- USB-C 3.1 Port
- 100W PD Charging port
- Gigabit Ethernet

# The Bad

It has an attached 6" cord. I've figured out a way to mount it to my desk's stand so that the cord doesn't get bent at an awkward (and potentially damaging) angle, but it would've been nice to have the option to supply my own cord.

# The Ugly

It comes with a silicon sleeve around it that adds a bunch of bulk for the sole purpose to give you something to tuck the cord into when you travel with it... Ironically, that extra bulk was what made it not fit in my little travel bag, so I just added one of these extra-long [cord ties](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TTPX4KB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) to it.
