# The Good

Folds up small, and the gap between the arms at the bottom is the perfect size for the DeckMate grip. I totally did that on purpose.

It's made of metal, so it is a bit heavier than I expected (

# The Bad

It... doesn't have a bottle opener? I donno, it does its job.

# The Ugly

It's not the stand's fault, but I did stick a piece of Velcro to the back of it to mount the [Cable Matters Triple Monitor Dock](#/steamdeck/peripherals/cable-matters-triple-monitor-usb-c-hub). It works, though!
