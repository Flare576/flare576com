# The Good

I bought this as I was playing old-school NES-era RPGs (Dragon Warrior I, II, and III) and kept needing to refer to my phone for maps, guides, etc. Being able to pull the little arm out of my coat pocket, snap it onto the Steam Deck, and then MagSafe the phone onto the arm is fast, easy, and very **very** nerdy.

Additionally, the pack comes with an extra mount, which I've attached to a stand for taking Ebay pictures, so it's even more useful for me.

The ability for the Deckmate to hold two MicroSD cards pretty securely also adds to the utility. 

# The Bad

The included MagSafe sticker is bit of a joke in my experience - the magnet in the arm is _probably_ stronger than the adhesion you're going to get from the sticker, so one or two uses and you'll be sticker-less. I'm an Android user, so all I had to do was buy a [MagSafe phone case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8TJP3PK?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and I was all set.

# The Ugly

I'll be honest, because I got the White OLED Steam Deck, the black mount looks a little jarring, but I've always been a fan of function over fashion.
