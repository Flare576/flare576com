# RetroArch: Remap Hotkey

In order to use some functions of RetroArch (such as Save State), you first need to press the "Hotkey" button, then the button to do the thing.

By default, that would mean `Select` + `R1`.

Some games, however, **use** `Select` for stuff... and some games use it for _RESET_, which is counter-productive to saving state (or progressing).

In order to solve that, you can add/remap the Hot Key, and with the Steam Deck, you've got lots of options (like the grip buttons!)

# How to Remap

While in-game:

1. Add a Hotkey
    1. Press both joysticks simultaneously (L3 + R3) to open the Quick Menu
    2. Press "B" to go back to the Main Menu
    3. Press "B" to go to the Navigation pane
    4. Use the D-pad to highlight "Settings"
    5. Select "Settings" with "A"
    6. Select "Input" with "A"
    7. Select "Hotkeys" with "A"
    8. Select "Hotkey Enable" with "A"
    9. Press a different button (I used L5, the bottom grip button)
2. Save your settings
    1. Press "B" Until you're back at the Main Menu's Navigation panel
    2. Use the D-pad to highlight "Main Menu"
    3. Select "Main Menu" with "A"
    4. Select "Quick Menu" with "A"
    5. Select "Overrides" with "A"
    6. Select "Save Core Overrides" with "A"
3. Resume your game and try your hotkey
    1. Press both joysticks simultaneously (L3 + R3) to resume the game
    2. **HOLD** your hotkey and press the right shoulder button (R1) - you should see a notification saying you saved state!

(if these steps don't work for you, PLEASE let me know [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/flare576.com) so I can update the instructions!)
