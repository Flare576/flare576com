Solution: Steam setting in Desktop Mode

# Desktop Mode

Ensure you've [started with Desktop Mode](#/steamdeck/guides/desktop-mode-sudo-password) and switch over.

Open Steam
1. Open Steam (I use the icon in the System Tray),
2. Click "Steam" in the top-left corner, choose "Settings"
3. Select "In Game"
4. Scroll down to "Save an external copy of my screenshots" - Toggle it on
5. Click "Change folder" next to "External screenshots folder"
6. Choose your sane folder (I prefer **`/home/deck/Pictures/screenshots`**)
7. Close settings

Now you'll never have to look through **`/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/userdata/...`** again!
