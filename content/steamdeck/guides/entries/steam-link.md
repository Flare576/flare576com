# Steam Link

This might actually be a tip for **any** computer running Steam, but I've only tried it with the Steam Deck.

## OSX

Open up the App Store, search for "Steam Link", and install it.

## Windows

I can't vouch for [these steps](https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/8/3105764348181505385/), but probably works?

### And Then

Run it and your Deck should show up. Click it.

That's literally it - now you can control your Steam Deck from your other computer, making it very easy to turn

Into
