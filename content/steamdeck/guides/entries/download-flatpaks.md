# Desktop Mode

Ensure you've [started with Desktop Mode](#/steamdeck/guides/desktop-mode-sudo-password) and switch over.

# There's Basically Nothing To It

You just need to know that you CAN do it.

1. Decide you want an application, and realize it's not in Discover
    - For example, I needed [OrcaSlicer](https://www.orcaslicer.com/) for my new ~~toy~~ tool
2. Find the app online
    - For example, on their [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases)
3. Download the `*x86_64.flatpak` file
    - On GitHub Release pages, you might need to expand the "Assets"
    - If there are options, you want **x86_64** or similar file
4. Double-click the file you downloaded

## Then What?

That's literally it. You'll probably get prompted for your password because you're installing apps from an unknown provider (i.e., not [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/)), but afterward, you'll just have your new app ready to rock.

It works pretty well.
