# That's It

I did this by accident once, and it changed the way I thought about Game Mode.

## Wait, SPOTIFY?!

Oh, yeah! [Add Desktop Apps to Game Mode](#steamdeck/guides/desktop-apps-from-game-mode).

## Bonus Tip

If you're playing a game with [RetroArch via EmuDeck](#steamdeck/guides/emudeck), you can turn down the game volume!

1. Open Audio Menu
    1. Press both joysticks (`L3`+`R3`) to open the Quick Menu
    2. Press `B` to go back to the Main Menu
    3. Press `B` to go to the Navigation pane
    4. Use the D-pad to highlight "Settings"
    5. Select "Settings" with `A`
    6. Select "Audio" with `A`
2. Adjust "Volume Gain (dB)
    1. Open Volume Gain (dB) with `A`
    2. Select a negative number (I went with -25)
3. Get back to gaming!
    1. Press both joysticks (`L3`+`R3`) to close the menu
