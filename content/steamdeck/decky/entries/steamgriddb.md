Solution: Install the "SteamGridDB" plugin for Decky Loader
```
````
# Prerequisite / Install

You'll need to [Install Decky Loader](#/steamdeck/decky/introduction) first!

Then, while in Game Mode, simply

1. Press the Quick Access button (`...`)
2. Go to the Decky icon (the plug)
3. Tap the store icon at the top
4. Find/Search for "SteamGridDB" and Install
5. (Optional) Customize the badge however you like via the new entry in Decky Loader!

# SteamGridDB

Anytime you buy a game on Steam, it'll come with icons, images, etc. that make it look [spectacular](https://youtu.be/wgNxAfBWC4M?t=39)... But what if you add a non-Steam game, or app, or a launcher? Well, you could dig into the config, or you could use this plugin!

# How to Use

First, open the game/launcher/etc. you want to adjust, then tap the Gear (⚙️) icon.

When the menu opens, if you don't see "Change Artwork", close the menu, then tap the Gear (⚙️) icon again - sometimes it takes an attempt or two for the plugin to inject itself to the menu.

Once you see "Change Artwork," tap it, and you'll be taken into the SteamGridDB UI.

In here, select the type of info you want to adjust at the top of the screen (or with the Left/Right bumper [`L1`/`R1`]), then select or enter the info. After you select your preferred image, just exit the menu!

If images stop displaying (I think there's a caching limit/issue), use the `X` button to turn a filter on/off, and it should refresh!
