```

# Prerequisite / Install

You'll need to [Install Decky Loader](#/steamdeck/decky/introduction) first!

Then, while in Game Mode, simply

1. Press the Quick Access button (`...`)
2. Go to the Decky icon (the plug)
3. Tap the store icon at the top
4. Find/Search for "Notebook" and Install
5. (Optional) Select your options and customization via the new entry in Decky Loader!

# Notebook

After installing it, you'll find it in the Decky menu. It's application-specific, so if you take notes in FFVII, you won't see the notes in Dragon Warrior, which is nice because the notes for one game won't make a lot of sense in another! There's honestly nothing fancy here, it's just very useful for puzzle games or making quick notes about plugins you need to re-install after you take screenshots...
