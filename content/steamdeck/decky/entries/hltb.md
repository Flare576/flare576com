# How Long To Beat (HLTB)

![HLTB Info](/images/thumbnail/hltb.png)

This one is mostly for the funsies, but sometimes it is useful to know how big a game is or compare yourself to the average times... But, bear in mind, skill isn't included, so if you (like me) can't beat [Enter the Gungeon](https://enterthegungeon.com/) in under 22.6 hours... Just know it's a #skillIssue.
