# Prerequisite / Install

You'll need to [Install Decky Loader](#/steamdeck/decky/introduction) first!

Then, while in Game Mode, simply

1. Press the Quick Access button (`...`)
2. Go to the Decky icon (the plug)
3. Tap the store icon at the top
4. Find/Search for "Playtime" and Install
5. (Optional) See weekly breakdowns and information from inside the Playtime entry in Decky Loader!

Steam will tell you a lot of information about how much you've played a game, but it won't tell you about Non-Steam titles, so you'll never know how long you've invested in Dragon Warrior for the NES... Unless you install this plugin!

Additionally, Playtime will show you a weekly summary and more information if you open its menu item in Decky Loader - it's actually pretty amazing.
