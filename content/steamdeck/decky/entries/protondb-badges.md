# Prerequisite / Install

You'll need to [Install Decky Loader](#/steamdeck/decky/introduction) first!

Then, while in Game Mode, simply

1. Press the Quick Access button (`...`)
2. Go to the Decky icon (the plug)
3. Tap the store icon at the top
4. Find/Search for "ProtonDB Badges" and Install
5. (Optional) Customize the badge however you like via the new entry in Decky Loader!

# ProtonDB Badges

![Example of badge](images/thumbnail/protondb_badge.png)

This plugin is simplistic, but incredibly useful - it just adds a little "Badge" to the top of the game's hero image at the top of its page in your library that reflects its rating from [ProtonDB](https://protondb.com). Tapping the badge will load the ProtonDB page for that game, so you can get additional information/advice about running the game on your Steam Deck.

## Ok, But What Is Proton?

If you want to see a fantastic video on the topic, I recommend [MonroeWorld's Proton 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfsb4M7swbE), but essentially Proton is a set of files, code, and other assets that Linux (and, in turn, SteamOS) can use to allow Windows applications run natively. It's not really "Emulation," because you're not _actually_ running Windows, you're just giving the game enough of the files it needs to operate.

## Then, What Is ProtonDB?

Like any other software, Proton goes through versions, early releases, and other iterations - so knowing WHICH version of Proton a game works best with is sometimes important information to have. ProtonDB keeps track of that, from actual player feedback, as well as offering advice about setting tweaks.
