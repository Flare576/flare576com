# Prerequisite / Install

You'll need to [Install Decky Loader](#/steamdeck/decky/introduction) first!

Then, while in Game Mode, simply

1. Press the Quick Access button (`...`)
2. Go to the Decky icon (the plug)
3. Tap the store icon at the top
4. Find/Search for "IsThereAnyDeal for Deck" and Install
5. (Optional) Select your "Country" and customization via the new entry in Decky Loader!

# Is There Any Deal

![Example of plugin](/images/thumbnail/is_there_any_deal.png)

It's literally [what it says on the tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Does_exactly_what_it_says_on_the_tin) - when you pull up a Steam store page, this plugin will hit the [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/)'s API and give you the best current price and where it is.

If you tap the banner, it will take you to the page for that game, and you can even see price history, so you'll know if you should wait for the next sale!

# Great, But How Do I Play A Game From Epic

I'm glad you asked! There's actually a few different ways to play games from "Third Party Launchers" like [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/), [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) and others, but I **HIGHLY** recommend [NonSteamLauncher](#steamdeck/guides/nonsteamlaunchers).
