# Introduction

At the end of Nov 2024, my wife donated to a charity during her sister-in-law's Twitch drive, and she was entered into a raffle. She didn't win the grand prize, but she did win _a_ prize.

**She won a 1TB Limited Edition White OLED Steam Deck.**

I don't actually know what the "Grand Prize" was, but it must have been a VIP meeting with God, because that's what it'd take to top this thing.

# Backstory

I should explain - I've been interested in a Steam Deck since it was originally announced back in July of 2021, but I avoided news, reviews, and basically any information about it. Another gaming system wasn't in our budget, and the hardware itself wasn't exactly in surplus.

Here's what I knew, and why I thought it was interesting compared to the Nintendo Switch that I owned:

- Handheld form factor: While significantly larger than the Nintendo Switch, it is still very much a "Handheld" system
    * Steam Deck measures 11.7" x 4.6" x 1.9" vs Switch at 9.5" x 4" x 0.6"
- Plays games from Steam Library: While the Switch had a lot of great games, I had nearly 1,000 games on Steam
    * Steam tells me I've been a member since 2005, so I've had time to build library
- Runs "Linux": Steam OS was at least _based_ on Linux, while the Switch ran it's own custom OS and was locked down
    * I figured that this meant Windows-only games wouldn't work (Spoiler: it **definitely** does not mean that)

# Pre-Arrival

She told me as soon as she found out, which was probably a mistake in terms of my overall productivity. I started digging into YouTube videos, write-ups, reviews, peripheral recommendations...

You know, basic Nerd obsession mode. If you know, you know.

This is when I got to thinking...

```flare
What if I... replaced my entire gaming rig? My daughter desperately needs a computer for her online school that's running a modern OS - her 2015 Macbook Pro is almost as old as she is. What would that take...
```

It turns out, not much.

## My "PC" needs

I'm pretty basic, honestly. At the time the benchmarks were:

- Able to run my current modern-game obsessions:
  -  [X4: Foundations](https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/)
  -  [EverSpace 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/)
- Able to run modern-games at a framerate above "Slide Show"
- Able to run modern-games at Low to Medium Graphics settings (I'm not picky, and my current PC was > 6-years-old, so I wasn't expecting an upgrade)
- Able to easily emulate older systems
- Able to run a modern web browser with 30+ tabs, videos, etc.
- Able to connect to two secondary monitors via Display Port
- Able to connect to a Keyboard/Mouse/Camera via my USB hub
- Able to keep my offline data backups for the house, family, friends, etc.
    * I had a 3TB RAID array in my PC that I used to recover and store family's data when their PCs died, sort of a "Disaster Recovery" service. Yeah, I know, I'm the "IT Support Grand Kid," stereotype, sue me.

Could the Steam Deck do all of those things?

### Yup

## Necessary Purchases

You can check out my [Peripherals & Accessories](#steamdeck/peripherals) reviews of all the crap I got, but at the end of the day...

(In case it's not clear - the content of both monitors is from the Steam Deck via Display Port in this shot. My work machine outputs HDMI to the monitors, and I switch signals between them)

# Wrap Up

I'm 100% Steam Deck at this point - my daughter is using my old gaming rig as her online schooling. It's been a learning process to transition from decades of Windows to Linux, but using a Mac for work has helped a lot.

I'll be posting guides, tricks I've learned, and other info about how to make this work (if you're so inclined), or how to do different parts of if to help you make the most of your Steam Deck!
