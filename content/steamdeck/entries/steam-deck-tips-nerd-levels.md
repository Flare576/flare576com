# Nerd Levels

A Steam Deck can be a lot of different things to different people - a handheld gaming machine, a media player, an emulation platform, or even a Linux PC.

I'm using it as all of those, and more, but I wanted a mechanism to let a reader quickly determine if the problem, solution, or review was likely to be meaningful to them.

I decided using a Nerd Level at the top of each article would probably be the easiest way for someone to do that. Here's a rough gauge of what each level means for the Problem/Goal and the Solution:

```nerd-level-0
Goal: Something that every Steam Deck user will want or need to do.
Solution:  Able to be done stock in Game Mode.
```
```nerd-level-1
Goal: Something that 90% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: Requires Desktop Mode.
```
```nerd-level-2
Goal: Something that 80% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: Requires downloading and running a script or tool.
```
```nerd-level-3
Goal: Something that 70% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: Will require entering 2 lines of text (so you MIGHT want an external keyboard).
```
```nerd-level-4
Goal: Something that 60% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: You'll want to use an external keyboard.
```
```nerd-level-5
Goal: Something that 50% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: You'll need to type commands into the Terminal.
```
```nerd-level-6
Goal: Something that 40% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: You'll need tools or programs installed with Pacman.
```
```nerd-level-7
Goal: Something that 30% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: You're probably going to want to do with a separate shell/account.
```
```nerd-level-8
Goal: Something that 20% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: You'll be writing or editing shell, python, etc. scripts.
```
```nerd-level-9
Goal: Something that 10% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: Perform dramatic, in-depth changes to your system or configuration.
```
```nerd-level-10
Goal: Something that 1% of Steam Deck users will want or need to do.
Solution: You're gonna need a screwdriver ðŸ˜²
```
