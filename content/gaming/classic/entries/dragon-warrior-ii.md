# Dragon Warrior II

![Dragon Warrior II Title](images/thumbnail/dw2_title.png)

Dragon Warrior II (or Dragon Quest II in Japan), from Enix, was released in the US in 1990. It builds on the world from Dragon Warrior, but is set 100 years later. When I said in my [Dragon Warrior](#gaming/classic/dragon-warrior-i?scrollTo=should-you-play-it) review that the story could be summarized in 2 sentences, I was exaggerating.

It only took 1.

Also, it's still a little hard to tell from the pixel art, but you might be starting to recognize the art styling of a certain anime artist...

# 100%

![26 hours](images/thumbnail/dw2_100.png)

26 hours sounds about right. There are very few opportunities to fast-forward during DWII - because you have 3 characters in your party, and one of them is very magic dependent, you get punished for "Hold in `A` in Fast-Forward" game play.

That's actually OK, though - the battles are much more engaging than in DW. There are still times where you're forced to "Patrol" a town until you have enough gold to kit out your party, or enough XP that you don't get slapped on your way to the next inn, but it feels more rewarding than DW.

![Dragon Warrior II Achievements](images/thumbnail/dw2_ra.png)

Most of the achievements are associated with leveling up - there's no randomness to when you get unlock a spell - Princess of Moonbrook Ollisa will always unlock **Open** at level 23, so you need to get her to at least that level. Talint needs to hit 28, and the Prince of Midenhall needs to hit 30. There are 3 or 4 that you need to go out-of-your way for, so I won't spoil those.

# Grinding XP

![Dragon Warrior II 9999 XP](images/thumbnail/dw2_9999.png)

One nice thing about DWII is that there are a couple of places where enemies summon help, so you can chain easy mobs for 20 minutes to hit 9.999 XP instead of wandering in circles for hours to achieve the same result...

Or you can find 8 metal slimes in one combat.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# Should You Play It

If JRPGs are your thing, Dragon Warrior II is as far back in the series as I'd recommend going. It introduces a three-member party system, allowing you to start to have a tank, healer... and whatever Talint is supposed to be. Distraction? Seriously, Princess Ollisa CARRIES - she gets the hardest-hitting magic move (Explodet) AND the best healing spell (HealAll). Talint gets Revive, but it can't be used in combat and he's _usually_ the one laying on the ground at the end of a fight that goes sideways.

There are far worse ways to spend your free time, but I'd highly recommend something like the [Deckmate](#steamdeck/peripherals/mechanism-deckmate-and-phone-mount) to hold your phone by the screen so you know where the hell you're going in the boat.

Or castle...

Or cave.

Games should have maps, is what I'm saying.
