# Lolo

![Lolo Title](images/thumbnail/lolo_title.png)

Lolo, from Hal Laboratories, was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. It features 50 puzzles spread across 10 "Floors." In true NES-era style, there's no in-game guide, but it does a fantastic job of introducing enemies and abilities incrementally and then having you use them in interesting ways.

I played this game a LOT with both my parents as a kid, and its simple mechanics and art means it holds up pretty well.

> Quick Note: I don't know why it says 22hr 40min - I don't recall leaving the game open overnight or anything, and I **know** I didn't actually play it this long

The RA achievements are all pretty straight forward:

- Don't die
- Don't reset
- Beat the game in one session

I honestly don't remember how hard the levels are SUPPOSED to be - I've played them all so many times that only one or two consistently give me trouble - but the How Long To Beat says it should take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours.

# Emulator Tip

Generally, your emulator is setup to use a "HotKey" to activate features like saving/loading state, Fast-forward, etc., and that key _generally_ defaults to Select... But Lolo maps _Select_ to "Reset Level." As you can imagine, this is less-than-ideal if your reflex is to save state every level.

If you followed my [EmuDeck](#/steamdeck/guides/emudeck) guide, you're using RetroArch for NES Emulation, and if you'd like to remap the controls, you can follow my [Remap Hotkey Guide](#/steamdeck/guides/retroarch-remap-hotkey).

# Should You Play It

The first level will give you everything you need to know about the core loop of the game, so if "NES-era puzzle game" sounds interesting, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not loading the game up and trying it yourself.
