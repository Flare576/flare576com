# Dragon Warrior III

![Dragon Warrior III Title](images/thumbnail/dw3_title.png)

Dragon Warrior III (or Dragon Quest III in Japan) is a traditional Japanese Role Playing Game (JRPG) from Enix. It was originally released on the NES in the US in 1988. It has since been re-released on a number of platforms, most recently in 2024 on the Switch, PS5, etc. etc.

I only ever played the NES version, though, and that one is over 35 years old... That said, even though the statute of limitations is well past, I'm going to try to limit the spoilers.

# Opening

![Dragon Warrior III Chrono](images/thumbnail/dw3_chrono.png)

Chrono Trigger, one of my other favorite RPGs, drew heavy inspiration from the Dragon Warrior/Quest games, and the opening scene of DWIII should look familiar to any fans of that series.

> I mentioned it during my review of [Dragon Warrior II](#gaming/classic/dragon-warrior-ii), but this inspiration is in no small part due to [Akira Toriyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Toriyama) (as well as [Yuji Horii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuji_Horii)) being the primary art (and story) contributors for both.

Within moments of starting the game, you'll be exposed to the first sign that DWIII is dramatically different than the previous installments:

```flare
In Dragon Warrior III, there is no set party configuration.
```

You can have up to 3 companion characters, and they can be any combination of 8 different classes. The classes impact everything from the weapon/armor they can equip, the spells they will learn, how their stats increase...

Oh, and if you play your cards right, you can even make a [LotR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meOCdyS7ORE) reference!

## Side Quests / Gags

I think my game realizes I have a tradition to uphold.

And this Soldier NPC is a man after my own heart.

At one point, DWIII goes a little bit "Metroidvania," where a king makes you go across the entire main continent to retrieve the most important, valuable, crucial item in the game.

# 100%

![Dragon Warrior III 100%](images/thumbnail/dw3_100.png)

I think the achievement that ended up being the most time consuming was [We're Not Scared](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/50651). Essentially, there's an item in the game that weakens the final boss, and this achievement is for defeating the boss without it.

You know, classic "Hard mode" type of stuff. The beauty of DWIII on the Steam Deck, though, is that there's a lot of opportunity for Fast-Forward and "Hold `A`" to grind up levels.

## Grinding Levels/Gold

I think, except for that achievement, DWIII is pretty well balanced - you'll need to spend some time building up funds for gear, but by the time you can afford the new stuff, your characters will be well-leveled, too.

# Victory!

The end of the game is legitimately amazing. I took a screenshot that I wanted to include in this write up, but I can't bring myself to post it in the off-chance that this post encourages someone to play the game.

So, instead, I give you this: My party member petting a cat instead of talking to thankful villagers.

# Should You Play It

Yeah! I think if you're looking for a NES JRPG to crack the ice, you'll find a lot to love with DWIII.

## Recommendations

I'm hesitant to tell you how to play your game, but after playing through it twice (the first time didn't have achievements enabled), I'd like offer some friendly advice:

1. Start with a less-than-traditional load-out:
    - Hero
    - Warrior
    - Fighter
    - Pilgrim
2. Don't cheat the Monster Fights
    - Because you can save-state or rewind, you can theoretically bet on a monster, let the fight happen, see the victor, and go back and win 100% of the time.
    - It's not **really** worth it - you'd be better served walking around the town and fighting for XP+Gold.
3. Don't change professions on everyone all at the same time, but DO change their professions
    - There's a location where you can change the class of your companions once they hit lvl 20
    - The way class changing works on NES is that you start back at level 1 but:
      - Keep all your spells
      - All of your current stats are cut in 1/2 and added to the starting stats of the class you selected. For example:
        - If your Fighter has 100 Strength and you switch to a Soldier, you'll start with 50 + Soldier.startingStrength
    - Flip your Fighter to Soldier, and vice-versa, at around lvl 30
    - Flip your Pilgrim to a Sage once you're happy with their spells
4. Just use all of the Seeds of Vitality/Intelligence/etc. on your Hero. You can Min/Max, plan, hoard... [but why](https://tenor.com/view/ryan-reynolds-but-why-gif-12079644)?

# Resources

~~I got tired of having to look up each piece of equipment as I went between shops, so I made an [Equipment Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQRjjLBX0vpr6rczxtb7lnsmQHQNQlpWT1OrCZ6QqbA/edit?usp=sharing) that lists the equipment in ascending stats.~~

~~I have an idea to turn that into a bit of a more user-friendly web tool, but since I just finished the game it's only going to happen if either~~

1. ~~Another game I pick up needs something like that~~
2. ~~You ask me to do it on [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/flare576.com)~~

Against my better judgement, I started playing Dragon Warrior IV and it totally needed this, so I built it!
