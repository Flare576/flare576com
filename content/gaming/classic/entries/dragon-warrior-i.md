# Dragon Warrior

![Dragon Warrior Title](images/thumbnail/dw_title.png)

Dragon Warrior (or Dragon Quest in Japan), from Enix, was released in the US in 1989. It was Enix's first title on the NES, and it was one of the early entries into the Japanese-style Role Playing Games (JRPG). The story is short, even by the standards of the NES, and most of the game is walking in circles grinding XP or Gold to progress.

I remember playing this game before school... Though, looking back, I have no idea HOW considering the only way to save in-game is to travel all the way back to the first castle.

I'm _pretty sure_, based on this number of hours shown here, that RetroArch keeps track of in-game time, so the 20 minutes I spent in Fast-Forward grinding XP shows up as 2 hours (or however fast it went). I don't think I spent 21 real-time hours playing it, but 21 fast-forwarded hours sounds about right.

Some of the RA achievements were... Enlightening:

I had no idea you could do that.

I had forgotten about this guy. Dude just wants to sell radishes!

# Should You Play It

Absolutely not. The music is repetitious, the game play is repetitious, the battles are repetitious, the story can be summed up in 2 sentences, and the map is tiny.

Was it an important game? Absolutely. Was it fun to play in 1989? God yes. Do you need to play it to understand any of the other installments of Dragon [Quest|Warrior]? Not in the least.
