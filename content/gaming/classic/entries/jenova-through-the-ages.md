# FFVII - Jenova Through The Ages

```flare
Quick update! [Gary](https://garystorkamp.artstation.com/) let me know I had the origin of the image from _Final Fantasy VII - Original Game_ wrong! I'd previously described it as "From Shinra Tower," but I've updated the post to be accurate. Thanks, Gary!

I'm going to be honest, I can't really spoil Jenova's story as I'm not 100% sure what it is, or if her story is the same between the original Final Fantasy VII and Remake/Rebirth.

But, I think that Jenova _exists_ is definitely **not** a spoiler.

## Final Fantasy VII - Original Game

After you leave Midgar, Cloud and the party meet in a nearby village and Cloud tells his tale of meeting Sephiroth and their shared mission to a Mako reactor. But the reactor is home to a terrible secret. As the scene plays out, you get this glimpse of Jenova. 

## Final Fantasy VII - Rebirth

This cutscene is part of the "Flashback" exposition that happens at the very beginning of FFVII:Rebirth, set 5 years before the events of Remake/Rebirth.

I love how similar this version of Jenova is to the original, from the bolts on the side of the plate to the hair/cables to the single eye being visible - awesome attention to detail.

## Final Fantasy VII - Remake

This is the only one I'd be worried about "Spoilers" for as it's literally the LAST chapter in the game, so I'll stick with broad-strokes.

Similar to the original, you get this scene during Aerith's rescue from Shinra Tower, but instead of being an easy-to-miss cutscene, it's front-and-center in The Drum, and is part of a much larger and more important narrative.

If you'd like to see the OG version of this scene (It's not _really_ inappropriate in context, but  I feel like taking a single frame out of the animation could be construed as vulgar), you can see it [via LetsPlayGGs on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apqLih5GFWE).
