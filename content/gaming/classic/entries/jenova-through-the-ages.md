# FFVII - Jenova Through The Ages

I'm going to be honest, I can't really spoil Jenova's story as I'm not 100% sure what it is, or if her story is the same between the original Final Fantasy VII and Remake/Rebirth.

But, I think that Jenova _exists_ is definitely **not** a spoiler. I'm presenting the screenshots in release order here, but I think the *Remake* and *Rebirth* images make it clear they're not in _chronological_ order.

## Final Fantasy VII - Original Game

You're treated to this view during your rescue mission to save Aerith from Shinra Tower if you follow Berret's example and peak into a testing pod. Unlike FFVII:Remake, this event happens within the first 5-10% of gameplay.

## Final Fantasy VII - Remake

This is the only one I'd be worried about "Spoilers" for as it's literally the LAST chapter in the game, so I'll stick with broad-strokes.

Similar to the original, you get this scene during Aerith's rescue from Shinra Tower, but instead of being an easy-to-miss cutscene, it's front-and-center in The Drum, and is part of a much larger and more important narrative.

## Final Fantasy VII - Rebirth

This cutscene is part of the "Flashback" exposition that happens at the very beginning of FFVII:Rebirth, set 5 years before the events of Remake/Rebirth.

I love how similar this version of Jenova is to the original, from the bolts on the side of the plate to the hair/cables to the single eye being visible - awesome attention to detail.
