# TL;DR

Set aside a few hours to get through the initial cutscenes, introductions and tutorials, but definitely give the demo a try if you're looking for a game with:

- A ton of story depth (Dystopia meets mystery novel meets horror meets...)
- Character development and variety
- Interesting combat mechanics (a strategic death can make all the difference)
- Gameplay variety (exploration, team management, location exploration)

# Actually, That Was Mostly It

Since I only played the demo, I don't actually have too much more to say except that the full game is on my wishlist for when I have a little smaller of a backlog of games to play.

I want to thank [RPG Site.net](https://www.rpgsite.net) for their [review of the game](https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/17252-the-hundred-line-conceptual-nightmare-i-love-it) that caught my eye in my news feed - the clever intro was enough to hook me.
