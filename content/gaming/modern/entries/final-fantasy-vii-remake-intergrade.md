# Some Backstory

Way back in 1997, Square released a game called [Final Fantay VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII). My friend [GaryStorkamp](https://bsky.app/profile/garystorkamp.bsky.social) has an epic story about how he acquired his copy, but honestly I can't remember if I had a [Playstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)) already or bought one for the game, but it hooked me. I spent over 999 hours with Cloud and his party, exploring Midgar and beyond, breeding and racing chocobos, maxing out materia, killing optional bosses...

I played a lot of FFVII, is what I'm saying.

# Fast-Forward 18 Years

Square Enix announced their plans to release a remake of FFVII in 2015, but that it would come out in 3 parts. The PS4 had been out for a few years already, so I was pretty sure that's the system it would release on... But I didn't own a PS4,  and I wasn't in the position to upgrade.

But that was OK - the game wouldn't be released for a little while... Like, **5 years** little while.

# Slow-Forward 5 Years

I pre-ordered Final Fantasy VII: Remake (Collector's Edition, because _shiny_) before I owned a PS4. My brother must have known of my plight, because mere weeks before release, he asked me if I wanted to buy his PS4.

Or maybe he was waiting until I'd tell him to name his price because I NEEEEEEDED it. He's a smart guy - probably that.

In any case, I dug in... And I played it horribly, terribly, regrettably wrong.

# How Do You Play A Game Wrong

I played it to beat it. I wanted to be "Ready" for the next installment, to get it out of the way.

You see, Final Fantasy VII:Remake takes place entirely within the city of Midgar - in the original, that's Disc 1 of 3 - some people go so far as to call Midgar the "Introduction" to FFVII.

I went into my experience on the PS4 raw off of spending hundreds of dollars, frustrated that I'd waited 5 years to play the introduction to a game, and raced through it. When I got to the end, I realized my mistake, but too late.

I'd ruined my chance to enjoy the game.

# Fast Forward (Again)

I tuned out.

They released DLC - Exclusive to the PS5. They released a PC port, "Intergrade", with the added DLC, but I wasn't interested.

Then, in 2024, Part 2 of the remake, entitled [Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Rebirth), released. Only on PS5. There was no way I was buying ANOTHER console to play the SECOND installment, only to eventually need to do it again in 4 years. I sort of gave up on FFVII...

Then I [acquired a Steam Deck](#/steamdeck/how-i-got-my-steam-deck), and Square Enix announced the PC release of Rebirth... and that it would be [Steam Deck Verified](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified).

I thought... Maybe?

Then, a week before release, Steam did what Steam always does - they released a **BUNDLE**. FFVII:Remake+Intergrade + FFVII:Rebirth Pre-order, 20% off.

Welp, it's not going to be cheaper than that for the next few years.

# So, How Is Rebirth?

I have no idea. I played Remake again.

Then I played it on Hard Mode.

Then I unlocked all the wardrobes, story lines, and quests.

Then I played Intergrade, and on hard, and to 100%.

Then I went BACK to Remake and fought the <span class="spoiler">hidden boss</span> and hit the last few achievements I missed.

And then 100%'d the main game.

I played from my desk, my couch, my kid's archery practice... And, most importantly, I **enjoyed** it.

I've avoided news and spoilers about Rebirth, almost inadvertently, since its PS5 release last year, so I'm going in blind save for the story from Remake/Intergrade...

But, I'll be playing that one *right* the first time.
