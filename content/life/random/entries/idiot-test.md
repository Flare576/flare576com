# I'm Not Stupid (And Neither Are You)

## Math

What is `2+2`? Ok, What is `2^2`? Great, What's `√4`? Nice! Even if you're not a mathematician, you can use the context of the previous questions to parse out what the answer might be.

## Cars

In a vehicle, when you "turn it on," what part of the car starts to spin really fast and makes everything work?

Even if you can't fix a car or know "Nothing" about them, you probably know that they have "engines" or "motors" or can describe that piece of one - it's a main component, and if you own a car, you live in fear of the little "Check engine light".

But what if I asked you what the recommended gap distance is on the spark plug for a Chevrolet 350?

You might know, but (statistically speaking), you wouldn't, and that's something people will use to convince you that you're stupid.

# You're Not

And you never were. People who know that the gap on the plugs of a Chevy 350 should be between _0.035"_ and _0.045"_ know it for a **reason** - either that's their job, or their passion (or they're writing a blog post and have Google).

## You're Passionate About Things, Too

How many albums does your favorite band have?

How large of gap do you leave to stitch in the ditch?

What's the Konami Code?

How long do you need to wait for gouache to dry?

What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

What's the hotkey for adding a layer in your image editor?

How many episodes does your favorite anime have?

# People In Your Circles Are Also Smart

You probably have someone in your life that knows [A LOT](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html).

You should tell them that you recognize it. Either as a dedication to their craft, their passion for their hobby, or their willingness to share what they know.

Then listen to their response.

## Modesty Isn't That Rare, It's Just Rarely Invoked

In my experience, people aren't told enough that their value is recognized, and when they are, they're automatic reaction is something along the lines of

```you
Nah, everyone knows that, I'm not that [smart|knowledgable|skilled|etc.].
```

So, when this happens, my advice to you is to keep your response short, sweet, and honest:

```flare
Thank you for being awesome.
```

It doesn't imply the need for a response, it brooks no argument, it conveys both your opinion and a matter of fact.

# Why This Matters

In an era of Google search, of LLMs having access to the entirety of our collective knowledge, of TikTok and Youtube and Facebook and X and Bluesky and dozens of other fire hoses of input, the average human is becoming more and more marginalized.

But you are a unique blend of experiences and knowledge.

And you have a responsibility.

## Keep Getting More Awesome

BECAUSE we live in the era of 24/7 data flow, it's up to you to filter out the crap - to actively **curate what you let in.**

How?

1.  **Cultivate Curiosity (and Depth):** Instead of trying to know *a little about everything*, lean into the things that genuinely fascinate you. Become the person who *does* know the specific hotkey, or the obscure band fact, or the nuanced history of something, because you love it. That passion, that willingness to dive deep, is a true mark of intelligence that no LLM can replicate.
2.  **Question Assumptions (Gently):** When you encounter new information, especially from those fire hoses, simply ask: "Where did this come from? Who benefits if I believe this? Does it challenge my existing understanding in a way that feels productive?" Not to be cynical, but to build a more robust and resilient understanding of the world. It’s about building discernment, not cynicism.
3.  **Engage with Your Circle's Awesomeness:** Remember those smart people you know? Don't just tell them they're awesome; *engage* with their awesome. Ask them questions, let them teach you, explore their passions. Learning from real humans, in context, is one of the most powerful ways to expand your own mind and keep your "awesome" muscle strong.

You're not stupid. You're brilliant, in your own way. And you have the power to keep getting even more awesome, by thoughtfully choosing what you learn, what you believe, and who you connect with. Go forth and shine.
