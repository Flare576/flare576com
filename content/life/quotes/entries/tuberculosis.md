# The Spark

My son sent me this video

# My response

```flare
Dad-Figure: "Trick question, Alice - Nothing changed about Tuberculosis - HUMANs changed - we discovered and refined the scientific process, we theorized, tested, and eventually discovered the cause, and ultimately the treatment, for Tuberculosis. It took literal centuries, Alice. And do you know what that cure was?"

Alice: "An Asthma inhaler"

Dad-Figure: "That's ri... NO DAMNIT!"
